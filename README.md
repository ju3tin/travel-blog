# Travel Blog

Milestone Project: User-Centric Frontend Development â€“ Code institute
This is my travel blog website to demonstrate my frontend development skills to prospective employers, the site was created using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap 4.
The travel blog site includes a simple introduction page with a title some text and links to other pages, then an image blurb going into more detail about the travel blog and the reason for the website, then onto another page where the viewer can explore travel tips and finally a page where the viewer can sign up to travel tips and a travel newsletter.

# UX

My intention making this travel blog website is to provide a website for people who are interested in travelling and looking for inspiration for where to travel to, they may be new to travelling or already be a frequent traveller. I have designed the site to be very simple easy to use and navigate with a simplistic design and user-friendly features.
I have included links to Youtube videos, images, text and links to travel guides to provide the user with different ways of gathering travel tips and travel inspiration. 
The user is also given an opportunity to be sent more travel information and tips by signing up to a travel newsletter.
